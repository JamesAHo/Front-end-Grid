Designed an architecture gallery to showcase artistic architectures around the world.

# Gallery Description
Using the power of CSS animations keyframe and grid template area. I can able to build 
a section based on certain areas of the grid. Keyframes helped to animate the grid from the left to right then main area. 
By using keyframe animations, it allows me to control over the areas that I want to perfom. The animation is gradually changing from one to another and it can also be changing orders.
